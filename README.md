# User Stories
1. Shoot stars to score points + collisions with stars kill you

  Players report collecting stars in lame. Players should have to shoot the stars to score points. Colliding with stars should also kill the player. Player should also see how many lives they have.

2. New life every 50 points + enemy “obstacles” that kill you

  Players should receive a new life for every 50 stars destroyed. But more lives don't come cheaply. New obstacles should appear that can collide with the player.

3. Shields with power limit and recharge

  Stars and obstacles are hard to dodge. Let players have a shield they can activate for a short duration that prevents them from exploding.

4. Enemies shoot back

  Add some new enemy types that appear and shoot at the player. Don't make them too smart!
